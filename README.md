# Echo Marks

Echo Marks is a mobile application designed to foster closer connections among people by allowing them to leave and listen to audio messages, or "echos," at specific locations. The aim is to mitigate the negative impacts of traditional messengers and social media on mental health and social interactions, as well as to encourage people to engage more deeply with their surroundings. Messengers and social media can have a detrimental impact on mental health and often distance people from the world around them. The research question we aim to address is: How can we use technology to avoid these negative impacts and bring people closer together? Our hypothesis is that by enabling people to leave an echo wherever they go, allowing others to listen to these traces later, we can deepen their connection to each other and to the world around them. To implement this, the goal is to create an app that allows users to leave and listen to echos whenever and wherever they want. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will include the following features: a map interface where users can view locations, the ability to record audio messages and link them to a specific location on the map, display of audio files on the map at their respective locations, and functionality for users to play audio messages left by others directly from the map.
